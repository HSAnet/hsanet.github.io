## Glimpse

Glimpse is a cross-platform network measurement tool with a twist. It gives you access to the usual network measurement tool box including ping, traceroute, a Speedtest and a few others, but when you install and use Glimpse, you automatically donate some bandwidth to our network measurement project. Glimpse is currently in beta testing and will arrive in an App-Store near you soon.
