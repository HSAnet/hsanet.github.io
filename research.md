### VAVIA - Reliable Connectivity for Networked Industrial Systems

There is a current trend towards connecting industrial systems to the Internet.
These systems often require a much more reliable connection to the Internet
compared to regular Internet connections. 

The VAVIA project is looking into mechanisms to reliably connect such systems
to the Internet. Together with two industrial partners, it uses commercial
devices to test new approaches to this problem and uses realistic settings
and work loads.

**project duration:** Apr. 1, 2016 - 31. March, 2018

### an Intelligent Measurement Plane for Future Network and Application Management                   

Decentralized and diverse, the Internet is resilient and universal. 
However, its distributed nature leads to operational brittleness and 
difficulty in identifying and tracking the root causes of performance 
and availability issues. The first step to improve this fragmentation 
is measurement: illuminating the currently obscure dynamics of the 
Internet. To address this, we advocate a measurement plane, or mPlane 
alongside the Internetâ€™s data and control planes. mPlane consists of 
a Distributed Measurement Infrastructure to perform active, passive 
and hybrid measurements; it operates at a wide variety of scales and 
dynamically supports new functionality. A Repository and Analysis 
layer collects, stores, and analyses the collected data via parallel 
processing and data mining. Finally, an Intelligent Reasoner 
iteratively drills down into the cause of an evidence, determining the 
conditions leading to given issues, and supporting the understanding 
of problem origins.
