In the US in particular but increasingly also in Europe, Start-Ups are all the
rage. Founding or at least working for a Start-Up has become the aim of many
graduates and professionals. The - rather slim - chance of tech riches or
mind-boggling office perks attracts talents from various fields but most notably
with technical backgrounds.

It is with great proud that we now announce that we have received successful funding for a
Start-Up ourselves! The EU and the BMWi are funding it through their
Exist program. It is called [Conntac], it will transform your support experience
and keeps us incredibly busy. So no more information for now, but stay
tuned to more exciting news on our latest adventure.
