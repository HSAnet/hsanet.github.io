We love Internet standards. We regularly go to the IETF. Members of the HSANet group have to date co-authored 6 RFCs and have chaired a few working groups in the IETF. We always strive to build our software using Internet standards. Sometimes the right standards do not exist and it might be useful to standardize the things we have built. Standardization however is a long and weary process. Success is uncertain, the end result might look very different from what you have built and in the middle of the process your funding might run out. Also, a standard is not always something the academic community values - at least not as much as a scientific publication. A researcher therefore has to carefully think about whether it is worth the effort and doable to attempt to standardize a protocol or protocol extension.

We analyzed the IETF document life-cycle of recent RFCs based on the datatracker database of the IETF. This analysis has been conducted for researchers that consider contributing research work to the IETF. There is a lot to consider in general ([RFC6417]) when coming to the IETF but an estimate of the potential time commitment is important, in particular when considering the typical funding/project/publication situation a lot of researchers are in. We wrote a paper about this analysis which as been accepted at the IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications & Networking ([CSCN]) - a conference dedicated to bridging the gap between standards professionals, industry and researchers. It will be held in October in Tokyo.

There will also be a workshop right after the conference in Yokohama where we will talk about our experience implementing [Glimpse]. The Research and Applications of Internet Measurements ([RAIM]) workshop is organized by the [IRTF] and [ISOC]. It is also intended to bring two communities together, the Internet Measurement academic community (the [IMC] conference is also taking place in Tokyo that week) and the IETF standardization community. This is great timing because the IETF meeting - the third standardization-related event in Japan in those two weeks - will also take place right after the workshop and of course we will go to the IETF meeting as well.

This will be interesting two weeks for us.

日本 - here we come.
