Who does not hate to apply for funding?! But you need it to do your projects
that are too big to do yourself in your spare time (which becomes less over time
- in part because you have to apply for more funding). 

Not every project proposal goes through and if it does not, you typically curse 
the reviewers, regret all the hours invested in writing and researching for the 
proposal and question the whole funding system.

But this time one got through and it is about to start! We are thrilled to start
working on the VAVIA project - a project that deals with the reliable and 
secure connection of industrial systems to the Internet.

A good question to ask now would be: why is that any different to attaching
other systems to the Internet? What's so special about industrial systems?
There are a few things that make them special. They e.g. they require often a higher
degree of reliability. E.g. being disconnected from your mail server for a 
minute is something that people would probably not even realize. But being
disconnected from an industrial system for such a long time might not be
tolerable. Also latency requirements are often stricter and they revceive less 
love from admins, i.e. they are poorly maintained, updated or patched. Often,
these systems are commissioned and then the wiring closets in which they sit
are not opened for the next 5 to 10 years. That makes them pretty special and
the VAVIA project will look into this with an industrial partner that manufacutures
such devices and another partner that runs them. We are all excited and cannot
wait to start our research.
