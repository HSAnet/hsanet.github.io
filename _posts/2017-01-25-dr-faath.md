In April 2013, Michael joined the Networking Group as a PhD student. The research
project he was hired for already ended in 2015. He stayed on board, working on his
dissertation, co-founded a start-up and just before Christmas, to be exact on the 22nd,
he had his PhD defense in Berlin. We at the group all firmly believe this is only
an intermediate step towards even greater accomplishments, but for now:

Congratulations, Dr. Michael Faath
