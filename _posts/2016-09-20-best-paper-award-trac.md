We have written before about our broadcast/multicast analysis and the experiments
we conducted on operational networks including the [IETF meeting network] during the 94th
IETF meeting in Yokohama. We wanted to know what privacy issues arise given the
increased popularity of broadcast- and multicast-based application-layer protocols for
things like service discovery. The result of this analysis can be found in our
[paper], which was presented at the [TRAC workshop] in Cyprus. For this work, we
had to go through a lot of trouble because the data collection was a very sensitive
issue which caused a substantial number of Emails on the IETF meeting mailing list
and we consulted with a larger number of lawyers over the course of many months.
We are therefore especially proud to have received the TRAC best paper award for
our work, because more than once it looked like this work will never be doable in 
the first place. Thanks to the many people that have helped us!
