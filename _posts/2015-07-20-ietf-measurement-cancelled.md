title:  "Cancelled - Broadcast protocol analysis during the 93rd IETF meeting in Prague"

A couple of days ago we have announced a small experiment that we wanted to 
carry out on the IETF wireless network. We wanted to analyze the broadcast and
multicast data being sent. Unfortunately, this experiment had to
be cancelled. The reason: it was impossible to get legal advice in time about
whether the experiment would be in accordance with EU and Czech Republic
data privacy law. Given that, the only sensible cause of action was to cancel
the experiment. But how did it come to this?

Only 17 minutes after announcing the experiment on the attendees mailing list
I was asked whether this experiment does not "fall
under human subjects rules for experiments and/or rules of privacy
protection?". Turns out, this question is not that easy to answer. A number of 
other participants joined the discussion and I also received a number of
off-list Emails expressing privacy concerns but also genuine interest in the 
experiment. The following 48 hours I spent a considerable amount of time 
talking to various lawyers and reading legal texts - none
of which I consider fun. Most frustrating for me - I couldn't get a definite
answer in time. Not even a definitive "no" which would have been fine and would
have saved me and others a lot of time. 

Common sense told me the experiment should be fine because 
broadcast and multicast messages are addressed
to everybody on the LAN so also to the device I was planning to put on 
the IETF Wifi network. It would have been a genuine recipient. Everybody on the 
LAN could do this exact same experiment easily. It was not unicast traffic we 
could access, which clearly is not acceptable. And then, IETF participants know 
how networks work and they are all aware that broadcast and multicast messages 
are out in the open for everyone to see - by design! They shouldn't be surprised 
by someone doing this but rather expect it. In the end however it came all down 
to legal questions and I learned that common sense and law are not always
well aligned.

I tried to come up with a real world anology because non-technical friends asked
about the problem. I told them it is kind of like walking in your neighborhood
talking through a megaphone. You intent this to be heard by someone in your
neighborhood but you don't know who exactly (e.g. everyone in the neighborhood who is
member of a certain political party). The other people hearing your words are 
not allowed to remember your words, tell them to anybody or process them (e.g.
make conclusions about what you heard, e.g. that you are also a member of that
political party or share their views). In many respects this is not a good
anology but it is really hard to come up with one.

So the experiment has been cancelled, but it started something which will 
hopefully be really, really useful in the end. Jari Arkko - the chair of the
IETF - has been extremely helpful in all of this. He has just announced that
there will be a small sub-committee who will review proposed experiments in the
future and will consult with legal advisors if necessary to see whether an 
experiment can actually legally be carried out. This is great! Especially as it
would have been so much easier to just not allow experiments on the network.

Maybe in a couple of months time you'll see another post from us: "Network
experiment at the IETF meeting in Yokohama... this time for real".
