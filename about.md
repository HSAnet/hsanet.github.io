The Networking Group's mission is to research and develop new networking 
technologies, protocols and applications with a focus on applied research - 
meaning that the results can be used and deployed in the near-term. As such, 
the group is building real systems and software and attempts to standardize 
protocols where possible to demonstrate the applicability of its research 
results.
