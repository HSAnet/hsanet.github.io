### Data Networks

Broadly speaking the Data Networks course introduces how the Internet works. The course introduces the Internet's key protocols, principles and practices on which the applications we all know and love run. The course starts at the very top of the Internet protocol stack with protocols such as HTTP which every student at least knows from the browser's navigation bar all the way down to Ethernet and all major protocols in between. After taking the course, students should be intimately familiar with how the Internet operates, how the protocols work together, how the Internet architecture functions and what the underlying principles for the Internet's success are.

### Operating Systems

Operating Systems today are an important aspect of every computer system out there ranging from small embedded systems over cellular phones all the way to super computers. Operating systems are evolving at a rapid pace but they are based on solid fundamental principles and concepts which are at the core of this course. Some of these concepts are found in process, memory or storage management, others concern security and protection. Linux will be used throughout the course as a kind of case study for all these principles. After taking the course, students will be familiar with the details of many of the tasks an operating system is responsible for and they will be able to make use of operating system services through (POSIX) system calls.

### Cross-platform Software Development with C++ and Qt

TBD

### Student Network Management Project (SNMP)

The SNMP's mission is to help to manage, monitor, troubleshoot and evolve the university network. The group maintains and operates its own Network Operations Center (NOC). Members of the SNMP receive special privileges and responsibilities to do this and they coordinate their activities with the university data center staff. Student will gain hands on experience working with a fairly large and complex network infrastructure and various network services (e.g. VPN, Email, and DNS). Students participate on a voluntary basis. Since members have certain privileges and access to infrastructure, the number of members in the group is strictly capped. Open positions in the group will be announced over the university mailing list. Candidates already need to have a good understanding of general networking principles.
